# usingbytes-dsa #

Welcome to **usingbytes-dsa**, a comprehensive JavaScript library for common data structures and algorithms. 
This library is designed to be both educational and practical, 
providing implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms
that can be used in a variety of contexts, from learning computer
science concepts to solving real-world problems in
commercial projects.

## Features ##
1. Data Structures: Implementations of essential data structures such
as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs.

2. Algorithms: Collection of classic algorithms including sorting
algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), searching algorithms
(linear search, binary search), graph algorithms (BFS, DFS), 
and more.

3. Easy Integration: Modular and flexible design allows easy 
integration into both educational projects and commercial applications.
